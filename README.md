Anna Chuapetcharasopon's Professional Portfolio

This is a portfolio of all the coding projects that I have done. I have used HTML, CSS so far and in the future I will incoporate JavaScript projects as well.

The motivation for this project is to showcase my work for future employers to see my skill set. This website will hold all projects I complete in the coding bootcamp. Through this project I learned HTML and CSS structure and how to make a responsive design.

## Usage

Users can use the "About Me", "Work", and "Contact Me" navigation buttons at the top to be brought to the correct portion of the portfolio.

At the bottom of the page, you can use the links to contact me. I currently do not have a LinkedIn but once I create a profile I will link that as well.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

When you are in widescreen you will the navigation bars and the about me section span the width of the page, but when you make the screen smaller you will see the design turns into columns to help the user see all elements of the page propperly.
